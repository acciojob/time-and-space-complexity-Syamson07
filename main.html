  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets or performance-critical applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For instance, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input size, making it important to consider when optimizing for memory usage.
